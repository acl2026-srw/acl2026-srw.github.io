# Welcome to ACL SRW 2026!
The ACL 2025 Student Research Workshop (SRW) will be held in conjunction with [ACL 2026](https://2026.aclweb.org/) in San Diego, CA, from July 2 - 7, 2026. It is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community.

The workshop’s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including highschool, undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.

<!-- # Differences from Past SRWs
Similar to past SRWs, ACL 2025 SRW has two submission options--archival (appear in proceedings) and non-archival (only for presentation).
Authors can elect for both research papers and thesis proposals to be non-archival, in order to more explicitly encourage work in progress which can later be submitted to a future (archival) conference.
From a mentorship and reviewing standpoint, archival and nonarchival submissions are treated the same.

ACL 2025 SRW still has two different categories: thesis proposals and research papers.

See the [call for papers](cfp.md) for more details. -->
